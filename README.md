## 1.0 Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## 2.0 Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## 3.0 Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## 4.0 Description
This weather journal app communicates with the OpenWeatherAPI to allow the user to make entries by providing a zipcode and a comment.
Zipcode provided must be valid and appropriate error handling has been provided otherwise.
Latest entries are stored in the recentWeather.json file, allowing the system to retrieve the data of the entry before server shutdown.

## 5.0 Software
-- Visual Studio Code (code editor)
-- Firefox (Browser)
-- Node.js version 14.0.18 LTS

## 6.0 Version Control
This project uses git as a version control system, All commits can be viewed through the git bash command line using (git log --oneline).

## 7.0 Conclusion
This project is part of the (Front End Web Development Professional Nanodegree Program) at Udacity.
I had a lot of fun working with many of the things that I recently learned in this course and that enabled me to finish this project.
Thank you!
